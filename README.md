## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]()

Despite all the fancy screenshotting applications out there that have tons of features and customization options, I haven't really found one that matches my daily needs, so I decided to build my own.

Here's what simple-cap does:
* There are two modes to select from : Copy & Save
* Copy mode will basically let you crop the area you wish and then copy it to your clipboard. The application exits automatically after that.
* Save mode is like copy, except it will prompt you to save to a location after a crop (in PNG/JPG format) and exit the program right after as well.

That is all. I usually use screenshotting/cropping applications to copy code snippets and share them in my slack or discord servers. When I was using other screenshotting applications, I found the variety of features (such as built in image editors and just icon after icon) to be distracting from the true purpose, so I specifically made it to be super simple and close itself right after you're done to be minimally invasive.
